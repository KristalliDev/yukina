You know once you hear people say certain phrases often, you can always re-hear them in your mind even if they don’t verbally say them. I have a phrase my mom used to tell me quite a lot as a kid, and even now sometimes. The phrase goes something like, “Don’t cry. Crying is for the weak. You are strong. You should not cry.” The reason this phrase stuck with me is because in the past I would cry very easily. If anything went wrong or if someone said something that hurt me, my immediate response was to cry. It became almost instinctive. I still do it, though much less now.

Currently, I live on the second floor and my mom’s room is on the first, so even if I cry, my muffles won’t be heard by her. Back then, my room was right next to hers and I was caught pretty easily if I would cry. I remember the reasons I would cry too. For instance, if I had an exam the next day I’d be panicking over it. I would cry the moment I became vulnerable in front of my parents, and that is something that still happens to me. I also cried terribly because of period cramps. At those times, my mom would always repeat the same words, “Don’t cry. You are strong. You should not cry.”

I always thought about that statement as I grew up. Anytime in school if someone hurt my feelings, I would try not to cry, but it was impossible. That led me to rush to the washroom or the nurse’s office to cry where no one could see me being “weak.” At home, slowly I made sure never to cry in front of my parents, for the same reason. Up until grade ten, I think I did a pretty good job of crying only when I was alone or hurt. Sometimes, when they did find out, I would hear the same phrase out of my mother.

Today, something happened that made me feel extremely upset. I wasn’t sad-upset, but more of a hurt-upset because of something someone said. And obviously, tears started rolling down. My mom didn’t notice because I was alone. Later at dinner, the memory came back and as I was cleaning the table my eyes got a bit teary. When my mom asked why I was upset, I didn’t want to talk about it, so I just said I felt like crying. That night she messaged me on WhatsApp with the same phrase, telling me I needed to be strong.

I think I realized that day that I had become very suppressive of my emotions with the people around me. I noticed I would rather cry alone in my room than in front of anyone, and I would rather keep everything inside than express how I felt. Somehow, re-reading her text over and over again, it finally clicked in my brain. What my mom always said about being strong and not crying, I had taken her words in a strange way. My mom must have thought I had grown stronger emotionally and simply stopped crying, but in reality I was just hiding the fact that I felt like crying or that I was crying. I was not a ‘strong’ person at all. I felt extremely weak. That made me see how many things I tend to hide away just to seem “stronger.” What I thought made me stronger by hiding was actually what made me weak.

After that realization, my perspective on myself and what it means to be “strong” started to change. I realized I had actually been stronger when I was younger, when I allowed myself to express my emotions, because now I find myself terrified to show any negative feelings to others. I began to see that real strength was never about keeping a straight face or pretending I was fine, it was about being vulnerable enough to let others see the truth. Crying and expressing what I felt was actually the bravest thing I used to do, because it meant I trusted the world enough to show it my raw self. If I am afraid, I will always try to hide it, but when I allow myself to express it, I am facing it, and that takes courage. Ever since then, when tears come, whether they are from sadness, happiness, frustration, or anything else, I just let them fall wherever I am. Whether I am sharing experiences with friends, talking to my cousin about stress, or showing my dissatisfaction to my mom about something, I try to let myself be open. And I think this has not only helped me understand who I really am, but also made me realize that every time I allow myself to feel, I am choosing strength in a way I never understood before.

I still have difficulties fully showing my emotions to people. I know that will take time, and maybe a bit of unlearning, but I am trying. I never feel anything negative toward my mom for saying those words to me. I think when she was growing up, that was the best way she knew to protect herself and to show others that she was strong. She was simply passing on what had worked for her. She too had learned a way to guard her vulnerability, and that is how she carried herself. In understanding that, I feel like I am beginning to understand her more, and at the same time, I am slowly learning to define my own way of being strong. For me, strength no longer means silence or unexpressiveness but rather the courage to be seen as I am. And even if I am still learning how to do that, I think that journey itself is proof that I am stronger than before.
